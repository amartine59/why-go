: Today we're going to be looking at the Go programming language
: its features
: some pros and cons
: and case studies that involve its usage.

## About Go

.image images/go-portrait.gif
: - Go is an open-source programming language that is statically typed.
: - has a garbage collector.
: - and built-in concurrency(supported by Google).

## Pros
- Simple
: Go is a Swiss Army knife, but one that has stripped off all of the overhead and extra junk that has accreted onto programming platforms over the past few decades
: Its standard library doesn't aim to solve every problem out there but it enabled new tools to appear and they're good for the purpose they serve 

- Easy to Learn
: Go's lean syntax is easy to get used to. Plus, they have a few training materials
: My personal favorite is the Tour of Go which is an interactive site that walks you through Go's main features.

- Large Ecosystem of partners, communities & tools
: Go has a large ecosystem of partners, communities, and tools which are growing overtime and additionally
: Over the year, they conduct surveys for Go developers which allows them to gather feedback and improve based on it.


## Cons
- Hard to master
: According to a Go survey from 2020 over 70% of go devs
: feel productive within the first year, but
: learning how to write idiomatic Go is challenging
: especially, for those coming from a different programming paradigm

- Verbose Error Handling
: Some people complain that error handling leads to writing boilerplate.
: If it's not done correctly it can easily create clutter & mask problems.


- Not exactly object-oriented
: Go has types and methods but it doesn't have type hierarchy.
: Interfaces are a different concept, one that's easy to use and more general
: Embedded Types (Similar but not identical to - subclassing) 

## Case Studies

: Google - Web index services that support google search by keeping search results updated and comprehensive, are written in Go
: Cloudflare - Go is at the heart of CloudFlareâ€™s services including handling compression for high-latency HTTP connections, our entire DNS infrastructure, SSL, load testing and more.
: Cockroach Labs - How they chose Go 


: Go use cases
: - Cloud & Network services
: - CLIs
: - Web Development
: - DevOps & SRE
